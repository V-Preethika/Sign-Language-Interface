# ♿ Sign-Language-Interface

An AI-based community service project focused on empowering individuals with disabilities (blind, deaf, and mute) in Chennai by identifying real-world challenges and designing inclusive, technology-driven solutions to improve accessibility, communication, and independence.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was conducted as part of my B.Tech (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) academic curriculum. It involved field research in Chennai, interaction with disabled individuals, survey data collection, and the conceptual design of an Accessibility Assistance App aimed at improving day-to-day experiences for people with disabilities.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the challenges faced by disabled individuals.
- Identify gaps in accessibility related to communication, mobility, and public interaction.
- Design a user-friendly AI/ML-powered solution.
- Promote awareness of assistive technologies and inclusive design.

## 🧩 Key Features of the Proposed App

- 🔊 **Voice command + screen reader integration** for the visually impaired.
- ✋ **Sign language support and captioning tools** for the hearing impaired.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-speech and gesture-based communication tools** for those with speech disabilities.
- 🧠 **Customizable interface** based on user’s specific needs.

## 📍 Community Engagement

- Conducted surveys and direct interviews in Chennai neighborhoods.
- Collected insights from disabled individuals and local caregivers.
- Analyzed common accessibility barriers in public spaces and services.
- Raised awareness through on-ground interaction and reporting.

## 📊 Technologies and Tools

- **Python**
- **Google Forms**
- **Data Analysis (Survey & Visualization)**
- **AI/ML Research Concepts**
- (Proposed future tech: Android, Firebase, TensorFlow Lite)

## 🧪 Sample Survey Topics

- Type and cause of disability
- Knowledge of assistive tools and technologies
- Comfort level in communication and public settings
- Barriers to education, employment, and navigation
